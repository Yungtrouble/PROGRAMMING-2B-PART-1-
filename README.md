# PROGRAMMING-2B-PART-1-

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a prototype for a Windows-based application developed using .NET Core with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The system is designed to manage monthly claims submitted by lecturers and verified by program coordinators and academic managers.

This prototype provides a front-end user interface (UI) to demonstrate the system's basic functionality, including submitting claims, approving/rejecting claims, uploading supporting documents, and tracking the claim status. Note: This is a non-functional prototype at this stage, designed for visual representation.

Features
User Interface (UI):
Submit Claim: Lecturers can submit their claims.
Approve/Reject Claim: Program Coordinators and Academic Managers can verify and approve/reject the claims.
Upload Supporting Documents: Lecturers can upload any supporting documentation required for their claim.
Track Claim Status: Allows users to track the current status of their submitted claim.
Key Technologies Used:
C# (Advanced)
.NET Core
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class Diagram for Database Design (coming in future versions)
